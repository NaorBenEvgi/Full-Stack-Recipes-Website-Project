          We’ve known each other since the beginning of our military service in early 2013. We both took part of a course in unit 8200 in the Intelligence Force, which lasted a bit more than 5 months. As a part of the course, we got to know Lucy Aharish and we both fell in love with her!
          Like every home assignment in our studies, we decided to do this project together. Both of us enjoy developing and designing, a thing that made the assignments in this course enjoyable for us, and it taught us a lot about the web and its development.
          Another thing that we enjoyed in this project is the opportunity to pay tribute to our families and present some recipes we’ve grown up eating on our website.
          We hope you enjoy our website!
